/**
 * todo getPersistentStateKey - move to transformer.getId

 * This factory produces a set of transformers and defines applicability rules for them depending on current context.
 * The current context consists of node we try to apply transforms to, currently selected node and editor context.
 * Note that node to apply transforms to (N) can differ from currently selected node (CN) if isAvailableInChildren()==true.
 * CN can be a child of N.
 *
 * Algorithm for checking factory applicability in current context.
 * 1. if !N.concept.isSubConcept(getApplicableConcept)     => factory not applicable
 * 2. if CN!=N && !isAvailableInChildren                   => factory not applicable
 * 3. if !isApplicable(N, editorContext)                   => factory not applicable
 * 4. if CN!=N && !isAvailableInChild(N,CN,editorContext)  => factory not applicable
 * 5. If all previous checks passed, invoke getTreeTransformers(N, CN, editorContext)

Building MPS from sources
-------------------------

1. Clone MPS
2. Open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea) (either Community or Ultimate Edition)
3. Attach JDK 8 to the project
4. Rebuild the project from the _Build_ menu (will take quite a while the first time)
5. Run the _MPSLauncher_ run configuration in the _Run_ menu
6. Once MPS starts, open the _MPS_ project (point MPS to the root folder of what you've cloned)

Download
--------

If you'd prefer a ready-to-use build, please head over to the [Download](http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download/) page and grab an installation package of your choice.

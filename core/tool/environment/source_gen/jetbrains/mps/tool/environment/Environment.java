/**
 * Intended to be used in headless runs, represents working MPS environment.
 * Currently it is cached for all tests in the case of group test runs (suites).
 * To initialize environment in a lazy way (trying to get cached environment if available)
 * use MPSEnvironment or IdeaEnvironment #getOrCreate methods.
 * Use MPSEnvironment if you do not need the idea platform, IdeaEnvironment otherwise.
 * These methods use ref counting to dispose the environment in the right time (at the end of suite or at the end of the test);
 * they call the method #retain to increase the reference counter.
 * 
 * The common pattern in tests is to call #getOrCreate method in the @BeforeClass section,
 * and call #release method in the @AfterClass section.
 * There are helping base classes: PlatformMpsTest and CoreMpsTest for the IdeaEnvironment and MpsEnvironment correspondingly.
 * 
 * AP: TODO consider merging all the project creation methods

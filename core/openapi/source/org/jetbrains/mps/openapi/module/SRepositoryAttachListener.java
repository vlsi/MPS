 * Variation of a repository listener that receives notifications when listener is attached to/detached from a repository.
 * Useful for listeners that need to perform certain initialization of own state the moment they get registered with a repository.
 * Also this variation comes handy for global listeners that track all repositories through <code>SRepositoryRegistry.addGlobalListener()</code>,

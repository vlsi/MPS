/**
 * AP:
 * An abstraction of path names similar to the {@link java.io.File}.
 * Represents an abstract absolute path (or location) on disk (might be non-existent).
 * Moreover might represents a path to some archive + path within the archive (unlike the {@link java.io.File}).
 *
 * FIXME
// * Another difference from the {@link java.io.File} is the one that this abstraction is supposed to be
// * platform-independent (sic!) meaning that the path
 * @see #getPath() for an example
 * FIXME
 *
 * Also it is an MPS abstraction around the IDEA platform file system {@link com.intellij.openapi.vfs.VirtualFile}.
 * IDEA provides an intelligent caching mechanism which might boost up the file system traversal (comparing to the {@link java.io.File}).
 * @see CachingFile
 *
 * It has no fallback implementation base on {@link java.io.File},
 * however there is a special singleton class {@link jetbrains.mps.vfs.FileSystem} with
 * method #getFileByPath which creates a suitable instance of IFile.
 *
 * These mechanism nevertheless is deprecated and must not be used.
 *
 * From 3.4 you are supposed to use the direct implementing classes of IFile.
 *
 * //TODO continue
 *
 * AP: I suggest to continue using this interface because dropping it might cause too much pain.
 * As long as it is (technically speaking) our internal api, we are more or less free to change it.
 *
 * This class mixes two different issues (as well as the {@link java.io.File}): it works with paths (which are strings) and
 * also it accesses the physical fs from time to time. I'd rather split it up.
 *
 * FIXME IFile is mutable
 * (as well as the java.io.File) I think it is unacceptable.
 * we define it as a pathname abstraction. That means that we cannot rename the IFile, we can only rename something
 * that lies at this pathname on disk. The IFile itself must not be touched in any way. Otherwise it is cumbersome.
 * The alternative is to reconsider the IFile contract.
 *

/**
 * Why methods of these class are deprecated and get removed one by one?
 * The reason is their contract is vague. Whether {@link #getAvailableClasses(String)} returns anonymous inner classes or not,
 * whether {@link #hasClass(String)} answers true for them and {@link #getClassBytes(String)} treats inner/anonymous classes in any special way.
 * What's in the name of inner class, whether it's dot-separated (human-friendly notation) or '$'-separated (computer-frriendly) is unspecified.
 * It is easier to throw this class away than to enforce a contract.

/**
 * PROVISIONAL API, likely to become generic and move somewhere else (like smodel module).
 *
 * Facility to keep (persist) data associated with a model. It's quite common task to keep information that is associated with a given model
 * but is not substantial/essential part of the model, or is specific to platform/implementation/process. We keep this in a form of named streams.
 *
 * Different aspects/locations are explicit now, however, they might become (or get extended with) generic accessor (once we need extensible set of locations).
 * With support for multiple generation targets, we would likely add appropriate accessors with target identification, however, at the moment,
 * with single generation target this doesn't seem reasonable.
 *
 * At the moment primary purpose is to abstract away output/cache location so that rest of the code doesn't care whether it shall call
 * TextGenUtil.getOutputDir, AbstractModule.getOutputPath or FileGenerationUtil.getDefaultOutputDir(), and callee code have control over locations queried.

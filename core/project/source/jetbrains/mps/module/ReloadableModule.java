/**
 * Represents a module which can be associated with some class loader.
 *
 * For example suppose there is a language module L in MPS.
 * Also let there be a solution S which uses the language L. Imagine that at some point you decide to
 * change the language L, e.g. change the editor representation for some concept C in the language L.
 * Obviously you expect MPS to change the UI appearance for the instances of the concept C in the solution S.
 * Moreover you want MPS to change the UI representation right after the used language L is generated and compiled.
 *
 * To enable such workflow MPS introduces its own class loading subsystem. Also it brings in a notion of reloadable modules --
 * such modules which can be redeployed during design-time in MPS.
 * So the language L in the given example is clearly a reloadable module.

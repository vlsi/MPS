    <p>The Introduce Field
      refactoring helps you simplify complicated statements in your code by moving a repeatedly calculated value into a field of the surrounding class.
        You can select an expression in the code and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:IntroduceField;</span>
        (<span class="control">Refactoring | Introduce Field</span> in the pop-up menu).</p>

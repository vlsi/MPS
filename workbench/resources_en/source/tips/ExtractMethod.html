    <p>The Extract Method
      refactoring helps you simplify complicated statements in your code by moving parts of your code into a newly created method.
      You can select several statements from a block of code and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ExtractMethod;</span>
        (<span class="control">Refactoring | Extract Method</span> in the pop-up menu).</p>

    <p>The Introduce Constant
      refactoring helps you simplify complicated statements in your code by moving a repeatedly calculated value into a constant.
        You can select an expression in the code and press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:IntroduceConstant;</span>
        (<span class="control">Refactoring | Introduce Constant</span> in the pop-up menu).</p>
